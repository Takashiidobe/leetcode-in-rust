## Insert Interval

### Problem

> You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where
> intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the
> ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by start.
> You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that
> represents the start and end of another interval.
>
> Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted
> in ascending order by start and intervals still does not have any
> overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
>
> Return intervals after the insertion.
