## Valid Anagram

### Problem

> Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `t` is an anagram of `s`,
> and false otherwise.

### Intuition

What constitutes an anagram? Two strings are anagrams if both strings
contain the same number of characters. For example, "abc" and "cba" are
anagrams, since they both have one a, one b, one c.
